## TrustFi Litepaper V1.2

## About TrustFi
TrustFi Network is a decentralized BaaS solution for DeFi market based on multichain environment, centering on early crypto assets issuance, liquidity management, community activities and DAO governance to unlock the potential of DeFi. A complete set of product portfolios developed by TrustFi, including IDO General Protocol (TrustFi Alpha), Decentralized Staking Contract (TrustFi Beta) and Providing Liquidity Mining model (“PLM”), will stimulate the vitality of on-chain transactions, which aims to build an equal DeFi ecosystem and become an important supplement to the DeFi infrastructure built on Web 3.0. Activity on TrustFi Network is governed by TFI, the network's native token.

## Trying to Solve the Problem
Blockchain-cryptocurrency startups need to bootstrap liquidity, in order to ensure profitable trading prices on DEXs and other AMM-based platforms. In this context, there is a rising demand for decentralized, integrated, cross-chain ecosystems that enable Project Owners to easily and securely conduct pre-listing liquidity auctions. At the same time, with the decline of market enthusiasm, newly issued crypto assets will inevitably face the gradual decline of liquidity, and the vitality of token value will be difficult to sustain after listing. There is a lack of simple and easy-to-use liquidity management tools to help startups lock and release liquidity, and unlock the potential of on-chain DAO to build an equal DeFi ecosystem.
